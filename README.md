## 📖 Project Overview
This project validates the feasibility of using **77GHz FMCW Radar** for non-contact monitoring of Heart Rate (HR) and Breathing Rate (BR). It covers the complete signal processing chain from IF signal acquisition to vibration extraction.

### 🛠 Key Technical Contributions
- **FMCW Signal Modeling:** Detailed derivation of Beat Frequency and Phase modulation.
- **Signal Processing:** Implementation of Range-FFT and Vibration-FFT for sub-millimeter displacement tracking.
- **Advanced Algorithms:** Phase Unwrapping, DC Compensation, and De-trending to isolate HR/BR components.
- **Validation:** Comparative analysis with **Hexoskin** reference sensors.
